# [Wordpress plugin] Crawler homepage

This program was done for a technical assessment for WP Media.

The goal is to make a Wordpress plugin that :

* crawls the homepage to extract only internal links
* create a homepage.html
* create a sitemap.html with all the internal links
* add a link to the website to the generated sitemap.html

The explaination file for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/antoinemineau/crawler-homepage/Explaination.md).
